			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m Anu Sharma. This blog is my space to share my thoughts and experiences .
                I started this blog because I want to share out my ideas and thoughts with you.
                Here, you’ll find everything about how a normal private college student [especially KRMU] feels. Whether you're looking for sorrow or joy or just want to have some gossip you will definitely find it.            
                When I’m not blogging, you can usually find me in KRMU.Don't feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions because I am introvert so I will not answer it.                
                Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring the blog as much as I enjoy creating it.</p>
